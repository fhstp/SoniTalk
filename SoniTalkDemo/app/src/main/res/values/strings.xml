    <string name="about_us_text">Ultrasonic communication (UC) is increasingly used for data exchange between mobile phones and other devices, as well as for location-based services. UC is attractive because it is inaudible and very low-threshold in terms of the hardware required (only microphone and speaker required). Today, there exist several proprietary solutions for UC on the market, which are developed by companies in a closed source form, which raises questions regarding the protection of users\' privacy, since it is not clear which data is actually sent, when and to whom.
\n\nSoniTalk is a novel open and transparent protocol for ultrasonic communication between devices such as smartphones, TVs, and IoT devices. Thereby SoniTalk gives the user full control over her privacy by a fine grained permission system.
\n\nThe project SoniTalk has been financially supported by the funding program netidee (http://www.netidee.at) and has been developed in a research project at the Institute for Creative Media Technologies at the University of Applied Sciences Sankt Pölten (http://sonitalk.fhstp.ac.at).
\n\nThe project was pursued by Matthias Zeppelzauer, Alexis Ringot and Florian Taurer at the Media Computing Group of the University of Applied Sciences in St. Pölten. In the future, SoniTalk could benefit various industries as well as end consumers with new communication possibilities.
\n\nIn case of questions, bugs, ideas, please contact us directly under http://sonitalk.fhstp.ac.at/#contact.</string>

    <string name="instructions_text">Welcome to the SoniTalk Demo app.
\n\nThis app demonstrates the use of the SoniTalk protocol for communication over sound. The default setting uses (near) ultrasonic frequencies.
\n\nYou can type in a message and send it by tapping on the button next to the text.
\n\nTo receive a message, you only need to tap on the ear button. Received messages will be shown next to it. If a message was detected but could not be decoded, you will see the following message: (%s)
\nYou can try to receive the message again and/or change settings. Please make sure that the device sending and the device receiving use the same configuration.
\n\nThe SoniTalk Demo app needs access to the microphone for receiving messages and the custom data-over-sound permission to send and receive messages.
\n\nWe do not transmit any data from your phone (apart from the text you decide to send) and do not store any privacy-sensitive data.</string>
